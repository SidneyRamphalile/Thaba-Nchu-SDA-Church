      <h1 style="text-align: center;" class="p-4">HEAD DEACONESS</h1>
      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;" class="m-4">A deaconess ministry in a Christian church is a 
        group of women who serve the congregation and community. Deaconess duties vary greatly among 
        denominations, but responsibilities generally include such tasks as assisting with church ordinances, 
        supporting the clergy, ministering to the needy and educating female church members. While deaconesses 
        are sometimes ordained, they're typically considered part of the lay ministry.
     <ol>
         <li>
            Deaconesses prepare garments and towels for water baptisms and help female candidates dress and enter 
            the water. Episcopal deaconesses can sometimes perform infant baptisms in the absence of a priest. 
            Deaconesses also arrange the table setting for the Lord's Supper. A Seventh Day Adventist deaconess 
            might also assist with distributing Holy Communion. Deaconesses are responsible for purchasing, 
            cleaning, maintaining and discarding objects used for the ordinances of baptism and Holy Communion.
         </li>
         <li>
            Deaconesses will often accompany deacons or clergy members on visits to female church members to 
            uphold standards of modesty and privacy. Deaconesses may also take an active role during meetings 
            by ushering parishioners into the sanctuary and seeing that they are comfortable. In the Episcopal 
            faith, deaconesses may read the morning and evening prayer and the Litany in the absence of the 
            priest and with approval from the bishop. Among Seventh Day Adventists, deaconesses are also 
            tasked with maintaining the appearance of church grounds.
         </li>
         <li>Deaconesses help families in times of crisis, such as death or illness. They will comfort families 
             by providing moral support and relieve a family's stress by preparing hot meals and coordinating 
             childcare. They will often send flowers on behalf of the church. Deaconesses regularly visit the 
             sick and shut-in who can't attend weekly meetings. They spearhead charitable efforts to help the 
             poor in the community.</li>
         <li>Deaconesses promote the general welfare of females in the church. They educate women in the faith 
             and counsel them through issues. They do this through formal teaching and informal, personal 
             discussions. Deaconesses may even organize wedding or baby showers for women associated with the 
             church to show support and joy for life's milestones.</li>
