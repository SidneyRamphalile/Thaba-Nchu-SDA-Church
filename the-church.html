        When you think of the word "church," what comes to mind? Is it a building with stained glass windows? Is it 
        people dressed up, congregating to sing hymns? The Church, as Scripture defines it, has little to do with a 
        building at all. The collective Church refers to the family of believers in Christ. And Seventh-day Adventists 
        consider this belief to be central to their mission in sharing the gospel and being of service to one another.
        We will look to the Bible to find out more about:

  </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>What is the church, as defined by Scripture?</strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">The Bible tells us the church is the community of believers who confess Jesus Christ as Lord and 
      Saviour. In fact, the word "church" comes from the Greek word ecclesia which means "an assembly of people."  
    </p> 
    <p class="m-4"><i>"For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them" (Matthew 18:20, ESV).</i>
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Acts 20:28 describes this "church of God" as the people who Jesus "obtained with His own blood" 
      (ESV), meaning those who have accepted that <a href="the-life-death-and-resurrection-of-christ.html"
      style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Jesus died for them</a> to save them.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><a href="god-the-father.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">God</a> is a relational 
      God, and He knows the benefits a strong faith community can bring to each person. It helps us grow in our faith 
      while we also learn more about <a href="unity-in-the-body-of-christ.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">working together</a> and appreciating the uniqueness of each person.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">The Bible also gives the church community of believers guidelines on how they are to relate to and 
      lift one another up.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Those in the Church can support each other by: 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      <ol>
        <li>Loving one another (1 John 4:11)</li>
        <li>Fellowship (Hebrews 10:24-25)</li>
        <li>Encouraging one another (1 Corinthians 14:26)</li>
        <li>Praying for one another (Galatians 6:2)</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      It's important to remember that being a part of a community of any kind can be challenging. No one is perfect and 
      imperfect people make mistakes. Misunderstandings and conflicts can lead church members to feel hurt, sad, or 
      misunderstood. 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      But it's through the trials of learning to work together that the people of God <a href="growing-in-christ.html"
      style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">grow</a> in accordance to His purpose. 
      Through <a href="prayer.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">prayer</a> and compassion-and even pain and sorrow-God teaches us how to love each other better. 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      <i>"Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another" (Proverbs 27:17, ESV).</i>
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      <i>"Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you" 
        (Ephesians 4:32, ESV).</i>
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      God doesn't just call individuals to work on their own for the <a href="the-new-earth.html" 
      style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">kingdom of Heaven</a>. He calls the church community as 
      a whole to work together. Church members can do so much more to spread the gospel when they work together. 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      Some of the various functions of the church are:
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      <ul>
        <li>Teaching (Colossians 3:16)</li>
        <li>Hold each other accountable (Galatians 6:1-2)</li>
        <li><a href="the-lords-supper.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Communion</a> (1 Corinthians 11:26)</li>
        <li>Prayer and praying for one another (James 5:16)</li>
        <li>Evangelism (Matthew 28:19-20)</li>
      </ul>

  </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Who is in charge of the church?</strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">Is it the pastor? Church leaders? Church members?   
    </p> 
    <p class="m-4">These people all play a vital role in the church and the life of the church's ministry. Their 
      leadership is needed and useful.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">But the ultimate authority of the church is <a href="god-the-son.html" 
      style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Jesus Christ</a>, who is the cornerstone of the church. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone" 
      (Acts 4:11, ESV)</i>
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and 
      members of the household of God, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being 
      the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. </i>
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit" 
      (Ephesians 2:19-22, ESV). </i>
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      In the New Testament, Jesus established the church. The apostles were given a place of leadership and authority.
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      <i>"And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the 
      work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ" (Ephesians 4:11, 12, ESV).</i>
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      Jesus is the foundation of the church. Any church not built on the Lord, and following His Word, is not Christ's 
      church. Furthermore, any church or building not established by the Lord is built in vain. The people's labor is 
      for nothing. 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      <i>"Unless the LORD builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, 
        the watchman stays awake in vain." Psalm 127:1, ESV).</i>
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      However, God wants to teach us about loving leadership as well. That's why He sends the <a href="god-the-holy-spirit.html"
      style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Holy Spirit</a> to us, who 
      gives us <a href="spiritual-gifts-and-ministries.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">spiritual gifts</a> we can use for the building up of His Church. 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      The early church recognized the need for this leadership among their community to further the gospel commission. 
      Prayerfully, they made the decision to delegate various ministry jobs to members of the church with such gifts 
      (Acts 6:1-6). 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      The early church grew and so did its organization. But the authority of the church and church leaders always 
      remained in Jesus Christ
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      <i>"Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their 
        affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world" (James 1:27, ESV).</i>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Biblical metaphors for the church</strong></h2>
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>The church is the bride of Christ. </strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">With Christ represented as the bridegroom (Matthew 9:15, Matthew 25, Mark 2:19, John 3:29), many 
      places in the Bible refer to the Church as His Bride. This represents the ultimate love He has for His church of 
      believers.  
    </p> 
    <p class="m-4">The joy and commitment of a <a href="marriage-and-the-family.html" 
      style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">marriage</a> is the kind of care and dedication Jesus has for all 
      of us. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">And just as a bride prepares herself to meet her groom at her wedding, so the Church prepares itself 
      for the <a href="the-second-coming-of-christ.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Second Coming of Christ</a>. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"Let us rejoice and exult and give him the glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his 
      Bride has made herself ready" Revelation 19:7-9, ESV).</i>
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"For your Maker is your husband, the LORD of hosts is his name; and the Holy One of Israel is your 
      Redeemer, the God of the whole earth he is called" (Isaiah 54:5, ESV).</i>
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"...Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb" (Revelation 21:9, ESV). </i>
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      <i>"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices 
        greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. ..." (John 3:29, NKJV).</i>
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      This metaphor is taken a step further in the parable Jesus tells about the ten virgins waiting for the bridegroom. 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      Five of these women were wise, the other five were foolish. The bridegroom was delayed in his arrival, and while 
      the ten virgins waited they became tired and fell asleep. 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      The wise ones brought extra oil for their lamps, and the foolish ones did not. When the arrival of the bridegroom 
      was announced, they all prepared their lamps, and the foolish ones saw they were out of oil. 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      Since they weren't prepared, they had to go back into town to buy oil. While they were doing so, the bridegroom 
      arrived and the wedding began, so the door was shut. When they arrived, they were too late. They didn't get to 
      go to the wedding because they were not prepared (Matthew 25:1-13).
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      This parable likens the church to the ten virgins awaiting the bridegroom (Jesus). The ones who follow Him, obey 
      His teachings and are actively awaiting His return are the ones He saves. These are the characteristics of His 
      Church, the Bride of Christ.

  </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>The church is the body of Christ. </strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">The church as a community of believers is described as the body of Christ. This beautiful metaphor 
      illustrates the diversity of Jesus' worldwide community of followers. It also shows how each member of the church 
      is important.   
    </p> 
    <p class="m-4">Each Christian has a role to play in God's work. Everyone has been given <a href="stewardship.html" 
      style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">unique talents and special 
      gifts</a> they can use in their own ministry. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">If the church is the body of Christ, we see that Jesus is the head and each believer is a different 
      member of the body. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"And he is the head of the body, the church..." (Colossians 1:18, ESV).</i>
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are 
      one body, so also is Christ. ... Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually" (1 Corinthians 12:12, 27, 
      NKJV).</i>
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"From whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when 
      each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love" (Ephesians 4:16, ESV).  </i>
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      <i>"For the body does not consist of one member but of many. If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I 
        do not belong to the body," that would not make it any less a part of the body" (1 Corinthians 12:14, 15, ESV).</i>
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      Just as the body needs each organ to survive, each part of the Body of Christ is essential as well. This is to 
      illustrate that every person, no matter their gifts or talents, is valuable and has a purpose in the Church. 
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>The church is the family of God. </strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">The word "family" is defined as a unit of people who, through marriage, birth, or adoption, are 
      bonded together. Traditionally the nuclear family is made up of two parents and one or more children. But family 
      looks different for different people.  
    </p> 
    <p class="m-4">In the Bible the church is called the family of God. God is described as our Father. Fellow Christians 
      are described as our brothers and sisters in Christ.  
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints 
      and members of the household of God," Ephesians 2:19, ESV).</i>
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of 
      the household of faith" (Galatians 6:10, ESV).</i>
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      <i>"And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever 
        does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother" (Matthew 12:49, 50, ESV).</i>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>What the Church will be like near the End Times</strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">As the world descends into turmoil as things get closer to the Second Coming of Christ, the Church will be <a
      href="the-remnant-and-its-mission.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">God's faithful people</a> who hold onto 
      His teachings.  
    </p> 
    <p class="m-4">Even while the rest of the world distances themselves from God, those in God's Church remain faithful to Him. They will 
      stand out as holy among the wickedness of the world.  
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"... It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from mankind as firstfruits for God 
      and the Lamb" (Revelation 14:4, ESV).</i>. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">We are told that Jesus will "present the church to Himself in splendor" (Ephesians 5:27, ESV) when He returns to earth.

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Uplifting God's body of believers</strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">The biblical view of the church is a vital doctrine and is very important to Adventists. Jesus Christ is what makes the 
      idea of "the church" work in the first place. Without Jesus as the cornerstone of our church, all our work would be in vain.   
    </p> 
    <p class="m-4">When you visit an Adventist church, you are likely to find a group of believers who welcome you with open arms. The goal 
      of every Adventist church is to be a place where believers encourage one another to live each day for Jesus. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Each Adventist church is unique in the way they serve their communities and church members. But, you will find some 
      common themes in most Adventist churches:  
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      <ul>
        <li>Praying with one another</li>
        <li>Studying the Bible together</li>
        <li>Planning outreach activities</li>
        <li>Organizing children's activities</li>
        <li>Collecting donations for families in need</li>
        <li>Gathering together for worship and prayer </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Jesus is the reason we are a church. He's why we strive as a denomination to foster a community of believers who love, 
      support, and encourage one another. And all this is to help our friends find freedom, healing and hope in Jesus.
