        After the <a href="the-second-coming-of-christ.html" style="text-decoration: none" target="blank">Second Coming of Christ</a>, there is a 1000-year time period called The Millennium in which all the 
        believers reside in heaven until Satan and sin is forever destroyed, and the Earth is made new again. It's 
        mentioned in Revelation 20, explaining that these believers will "reign with <a href="god-the-son.html" style="text-decoration: none" target="blank">Christ</a>" (vs. 4) for that time 
        period. That sounds amazing. So what does that mean? How do we "reign with Christ" in heaven? And what else 
        happens during this 1000-year reign? And also, what about all the people who chose not to follow God? What 
        about the problem of sin? What is Satan going to be up to while we're all sitting in Heaven?
        Let's look to the Bible to found out more about: 
        <ul style="text-align: center; list-style: none; " class="text-success">
            <li >What the Millennium is</li>
            <li>The purpose of the Millennium in Heaven</li>
            <li>How does sin "end"?</li>
            <li>What the Millennium means for us today</li>
        </ul>

      <img class="img-fluid p-4" src="images/what-is-the-millennium-800x450.jpg" alt="The Bible turned to the book of Revelation" style="width: 600px; height: 380px;">
    </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>What is the Millennium?</strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4"><a href="word-of-god.html" style="text-decoration: none" target="blank">The Bible</a> speaks of a millennium, a thousand-year period of time where 
      God's people will be dwelling in heaven with Him while Satan and his fallen angels will be bound on earth.     
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">The simplest way to understand the millennium is to go straight to the source. The book of 
      Revelation gives a clear description of how this thousand-year piece of time is going to unfold.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless 
      pit and a great chain. And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and <strong>bound 
      him for a thousand years</strong>, and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, <strong>so that he might 
      not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended</strong>. After that he must be released for 
      a little while.</i> 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      <i>Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. <strong>Also I saw 
        the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who 
        had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. 
        They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. The rest of the dead did not come to life 
        until the thousand years were ended.</strong> This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is the one who shares 
        in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of 
        Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years" (Revelation 20:1-6, ESV, emphasis added).</i>
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img class="img-fluid p-4" src="images/what-is-the-millennium-2...this-millennium-800x450.jpg" alt="A pit" style="width: 600px; height: 380px;">
    </div>
    <p  class="m-4">This millennium, this thousand-year period, takes place between the first and second resurrection: 
      the resurrection of the righteous and the resurrection of the wicked. It begins with Satan being locked up in 
      a pit, along with all the angels who chose to follow him (Revelation 12:4).   
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">So where is this pit where Satan is to be locked up so he 'might not deceive the nations any 
      longer'? Though the Bible doesn't specifically state it, we can infer this pit refers to the earth after 
      the resurrection of the saints.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">All the righteous have already been taken up to Heaven to live with Christ (Revelation 20:4), and 
      the wicked are still <a href="death-and-resurrection.html" style="text-decoration: none" target="blank">dead in their graves</a> (Revelation 20:5). There is no one on earth for Satan to deceive. 
      The entire planet is empty, left in ruins, without a single human being (Jeremiah 4:24-26). 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      During that time, God's people will be with Him in heaven. Everyone who chose Jesus Christ will be there. The 
      believers will "reign with Christ for a thousand years," spending the millennium in the joys and wonders 
      of heaven. 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      This is the reward God promises to anyone who believes in Him, accepts Christ's grace, and follows <a href="the-law-of-god.html" style="text-decoration: none" target="blank">His 
      commandments</a> (Matthew 5:8).

    </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>What is the Purpose of the Millennium?</strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">Although it might sound perfectly wonderful and exciting to be spending our time in Heaven with 
      Jesus, the question still remains about what we'll be doing during the Millennium. What exactly is going to 
      be happening during these thousand years?    
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">What will reigning with Christ entail? The book of Revelation gives us some clues on this as well. 
      It mentions thrones and judgment (Revelation 20:4), but let's look for more details. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">The Apostle Paul offered this insight:   
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      <i>"Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you 
        incompetent to try trivial cases? Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, then, matters 
        pertaining to this life!" (1 Corinthians 6:2-3 ESV).</i> 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      During the Millennium we will be allowed to go through the records God has been keeping since earth began 
      (Revelation 20:12). <a href="god-the-father.html" style="text-decoration: none" target="blank">God</a> is going to read the records and judge the case of every person who's ever lived, 
      and we get to hear it all. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      We'll witness these people's lives, understand their motives, and see whether they ultimately <a href="the-great-controversy.html" style="text-decoration: none" target="blank">chose the side of 
      Christ or Satan</a>. We will know beyond the shadow of a doubt that God truly is a good and righteous judge.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      And what of Satan and his angels? What will they be doing during the thousand years? The Bible tells us that he'll 
      be stuck on earth with no one left to deceive.   
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      The human beings he tricked into following him are all dead and he is left with nothing but the remains of a 
      ruined planet. Perhaps this is God's final act of mercy towards him.   
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Perhaps the Millennium is meant to be Satan's last chance to look around, see where his arrogance 
      and rebellion have led him, and turn back. We can only speculate.    
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      It does say, however, that Satan is put in the one place where he can't hurt anyone anymore. And it promises that 
      after the Millennium, his evil deeds will be finished for good.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img class="img-fluid p-4" src="images/adventists-believe-8-800x450.jpg" alt="A lady relaxing on the grass" style="width: 600px; height: 380px;">
    </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>How will Sin end?</strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">It's no secret that the world we live in is broken. It's been that way ever since <a href="the-nature-of-man.html" style="text-decoration: none" target="blank">humanity rebelled</a> 
      in the Garden or Eden. But God promised us that this won't always be the case.   
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Jesus will return one day and put an end to sin, just as God promised through the prophet Malachi:
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will 
      be stubble. The day that is coming shall set them ablaze, says the Lord of hosts, so that it will leave 
      them neither root nor branch.</i>    
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      <i>But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings. You shall go out 
        leaping like calves from the stall. And you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the 
        soles of your feet, on the day when I act, says the Lord of hosts" (Malachi 4:1-3 ESV).</i> 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      God's word assures us that sin will one day be destroyed and the earth will be made whole again, just like it 
      was in the <a href="creation.html" style="text-decoration: none" target="blank">Garden of Eden</a>. The book of Revelation tells us exactly how it will happen. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      As the millennium comes to a close, God will remove the Holy City from Heaven and send it down to earth, ready to 
      heal the planet He created.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      <i>"And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive 
        the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their 
        number is like the sand of the sea. </i>  
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      <i>And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved 
        city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them, and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into 
        the lake of fire and sulfur..." (Revelation 20:7-10 ESV).</i>   
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img class="img-fluid p-4" src="images/how-will-sin-end-2...when-god-returns-to-earth-edited-800x450.jpg" alt="A lady reading her Bible" style="width: 600px; height: 380px;">
    </div>
    <p  class="m-4">When God returns to earth to cleanse it, He begins what is known as the second resurrection, 
      the resurrection of the wicked. This is when all those who rebelled against God, who refused Jesus and sided 
      with Satan, will be brought back to life to be judged (Revelation 20:5).  
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">When Satan sees all these people brought back to life, he tries his hand at one final deception. 
      He urges all the wicked to turn and attack the Holy City, claiming that they can conquer it and take it as 
      their own. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Satan and his army march right up to the Holy City and prepare to attack, but their rebellion is 
      short-lived. Fire falls from heaven and burns them up, leaving nothing but ashes. Satan and his followers are 
      utterly destroyed.   
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      Those who chose the side of sin and rebellion will be consumed in an instant. Satan however, the one responsible 
      for this whole deception, will be thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur. 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      Revelation says that Satan will burn forever and ever (Revelation 20:10). This, however, does not mean that 
      Satan will be spending all of eternity burning in torment. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      Satan is not immortal, nor would God leave him in a state of constant torture for all of eternity. Scripture 
      says that only the righteous will have eternal life (1 John 2:17).
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      However, Satan's punishment will be forever in the sense that it will be permanent. Once Satan is destroyed, 
      nothing in all creation can bring him back. And with Satan's ultimate death, evil dies too, releasing the 
      hold it once had on our world. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      This is what the end of sin looks like. With the fall of Satan and his followers, the corruption that has 
      plagued the earth will finally be eradicated. The disease will be burned away, and the whole earth will be 
      cleansed. 
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img class="img-fluid p-4" src="images/how-will-sin-end-3...this-is-what-scriptures-mean-800x450.jpg" alt="Fire" style="width: 600px; height: 380px;">
    </div>
    <p  class="m-4">This is what Scriptures means when it talks of the "second death" (Revelation 20:6), a 
      permanent destruction from which there can be no resurrection. Those who experience the second death 
      are gone for good, including Satan.   
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">When he is thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, he is finished. The sin he brought into the 
      world can never return again. With Satan's final destruction, evil is ended forever, and God's kingdom can 
      return to the <a href="the-new-earth.html" style="text-decoration: none" target="blank">glorious paradise</a> it was always meant to be.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed 
      away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, 
      prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. </i>   
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      <i>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell 
        with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away 
        every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor 
        pain anymore, for the former things have passed away."</i> 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      <i>And he who was seated on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." Also he said, "Write this 
        down, for these words are trustworthy and true"" (Revelation 21:1-5 ESV).</i> 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      This may be the most beautiful passage in all of scripture. It holds Jesus' ultimate promise, that one day He 
      will come back for us and make everything right again. All wounds will be healed, all losses will be restored. 
      We will be His people, like we were always meant to be, living in joy and peace with Him for all eternity. 
      What a glorious day that will be.
    </p>

      <img class="img-fluid p-4" src="images/millennium-impacts-us-today-800x450.jpg" alt="Married couple cuddling" style="width: 600px; height: 380px;">
    </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>How does the Millennium impact us today?</strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">Christ's promised Second Coming may feel like a distant vision, but the message of the Millennium 
      can give us great hope for the future, and motivate us to share the Gospel to those around us.   
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">It also reminds us that we will all have to give an account of ourselves one day (2 Peter 3:10-14). 
      Yet we learn that God is a good and righteous judge and He won't allow sin to rule forever. Eventually, He will 
      put an end to evil and death, making the whole world right again.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Knowing that evil will ultimately be destroyed-what can top that! How wonderful it will be to know 
      that the broken world we live in won't last forever and that God is already preparing a better home for us 
      where we can live with Him.
