        What does unity look like among many different groups of diverse people? The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a 
        worldwide denomination, spanning multiple cultures, languages, etc. However, while fully appreciating the 
        uniqueness <a href="creation.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="blank">God created us</a> with, Adventists also work together toward the same goal-sharing the gospel of Jesus 
        to the far corners of the earth. Just like Jesus and His disciples worked toward in the Bible, Adventists seek 
        to maintain a supportive unity of mission. So let's take a closer look at:

  </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>How Jesus Christ encouraged unity among believers</strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4"><a href="god-the-son.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Jesus</a> was never one to be confined by social convention. Whether it was making friends with 
      tax-collectors, healing lepers others were afraid to touch, or holding a conversation with the Samaritan woman at 
      the well, Jesus made it clear his Gospel was for everyone, not just Jews.   
    </p> 
    <p class="m-4">He made a point of reaching out to people who were categorically different from Him, sharing the good 
      news of his Father's love. And, right before he went back to heaven, he instructed his disciples to do the same.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, and that repentance for 
      the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name <b>to all nations</b>, beginning from Jerusalem" 
      (Luke 24:46-47, ESV, emphasis added).</i> 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Every single human being was intentionally created by <a href="god-the-father.html" 
      style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">God</a>, willed by Him into existence! And <a href="the-life-death-and-resurrection-of-christ.html"
      style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Christ's ministry</a> tells us 
      there's room enough in God's kingdom for everyone, regardless of nation, race, color, or culture. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us?" (Malachi 2:10, NKJV).</i>
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">A person's gender, financial status, or level of education should make no difference in the value of a person, or the 
      ability to work together with them. Jesus wants the <a href="the-experience-of-salvation.html" style="text-decoration: none;" 
      target="_blank">good news of salvation</a> to be spread across the entire world so everyone will have 
      the opportunity to join God's family and be a part of <a href="the-church.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">the Church, the Body of Christ</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      This is wonderful news! It means no one is going to be excluded or left out. It also means God's family will be diverse. 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      Think about it. If everyone on Earth will one day have a chance to hear the gospel, imagine how many different types of people 
      there'll be in <a href="heaven-and-the-new-earth.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Heaven</a>. Countless people from different countries, cultures, and even different times, speaking different languages 
      and having different opinions, personalities, and worldviews.
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      But one thought is hard to ignore: <i>How could such a disjointed family possibly work together and get anything done?</i> 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      Only through the power of the love of God.
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      When we accept God's grace and <a href="christian-behavior.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">choose to live by His ways</a>, we are brought into His family, the body of Christ. And God commands the 
      Body of Christ to be unified (Romans 12:4, 5, 16; Ephesians 4:3).
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      So, what does unity look like? How do we become unified with other believers and why is it so important? God answers all those questions 
      for us through his word.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;" >
      <img  class="img-fluid p-4" src="images/true-meaning-of-unity-1024x609.jpg" alt="People sitting in church" style="width: 600px; height: 350px;" class="responsive">
  </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>The true meaning of unity</strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">Christian unity means having a singular goal in mind and serving others rather than ourselves. But being unified doesn't 
      mean shutting off our individual personalities and becoming a blank slate for other people's ideas.   
    </p> 
    <p class="m-4">When we accept Christ's forgiveness and choose to live for him, we become a part of his worldwide family. And Jesus doesn't 
      want his family to have disunity or be divided by petty squabbles and clashes of ego. In fact, Jesus specifically prayed to God for his 
      followers to be unified right before he went back to Heaven.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your 
      name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one" (John 17:11, ESV).</i> 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Jesus used his bond with his Heavenly Father as an example for what he wanted the church body to be like. Jesus and the 
      Father were never at odds. They shared a strong bond, holding the same goals and knowing each other's hearts, working as one. That's 
      the kind of unity Jesus asked God to give to his followers. We are called to be unified, working together in Christ's name.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">For some people, this sounds wonderful, like being part of a huge, loving family that never argues or disagrees. Others 
      find the idea of unity stifling, feeling that conforming to some sort of group norm makes them less themselves.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;" >
      <img  class="img-fluid p-4" src="images/true-meaning-of-unity-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="A grand daughter and grandmother smiling at each other" style="width: 600px; height: 350px;" class="responsive">
  </div>
    <p  class="m-4"><strong><i>But unity doesn't mean uniformity. On the contrary, God recognizes and appreciates the skills and personalities 
      each of us have that make us unique. </i></strong>   
    </p> 
    <p class="m-4">He created us after all. We are, as the psalmist said, "fearfully and wonderfully made" (Psalm 139:14). God designed us to 
      be diverse, to have different strengths, skills, viewpoints, and opinions. But He wants us to use and appreciate those differences 
      instead of using them as the basis for arguments and self-pride.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Every person in the world is equally loved in God's eyes. Every person is valued and useful, albeit in different ways 
      (Romans 12:4-8). Rather than turning unity into uniformity and trying to fit everyone into the same mold, God asks us to embrace the 
      differences He created us with and work together.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">We can do this by figuring out how other people think, incorporating empathy into our interactions, and doing our best to 
      understand others, putting our own ambitions aside. Regardless of our different backgrounds, cultures, or opinions, there are two things 
      we all have in common: 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">
      <ul>
        <li>Our shared heritage from Adam and Eve.</li>
        <li>Our redemption in Christ. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      Once we come to grips with these two unifying factors, we can learn to look past first impressions and see people the way God wants us 
      to see them, as brothers and sisters in His family. That is how the church body becomes united in Christ.
    </p>

  </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>The Body of Christ</strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">Christ calls us to be unified. This concept of church unity is sometimes referred to as being a part of the Body of Christ. 
      Christ wants His people to be so in-tune with each other and with Him that they cooperate as if they were one body.
    </p> 
    <p class="m-4">But what does unity look like? How can people be united while still embracing their identity as individuals created by God. 
      How can a group of such different people be united and yet distinct?
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">The apostle Paul actually addresses this in one of his letters to the church in Corinth. He starts out by explaining to 
      them that God blesses different people with <a href="spiritual-gifts-and-ministries.html" style="text-decoration: none;" 
      target="_blank">different sorts of gifts</a>, all of which are to be used to honor him. One person might be skilled in healing, while 
      another might possess great wisdom or knowledge or a gift for languages. But each of them have worth and 
      value in God's church.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>"All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.</i> 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is 
      with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body-Jews or Greeks, slaves or free-and all were made to drink of one 
      Spirit.</i>
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"><i>For the body does not consist of one member but of many. If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not 
      belong to the body," that would not make it any less a part of the body. And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not 
      belong to the body," that would not make it any less a part of the body. If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of 
      hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. If all were a single member, where would the body be? As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
        <i>The eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you," nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you"... But God has so 
          composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, that there may be no division in the body, but that the members 
          may have the same care for one another. If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together" 
          (1 Corinthians 12:11-26 ESV).</i>

  </div>
    <p  class="m-4">This is what the body of Christ looks like. Hundreds of different organs performing different tasks all for the good of 
      the body. 
    </p> 
    <p class="m-4">When we are part of God's family, we shouldn't look at ourselves and think that just because we don't have the skills 
      someone else has, we don't belong in the church. Nor can we be so caught up with ourselves we believe we don't need other people and 
      can get to Heaven all on our own. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">God designed us to need each other. It's our calling as Christians to lift each other up, rather than trying to isolate 
      ourselves. Just like Paul's illustration of the body, the only way the church can be unified is if we recognize we are all different, 
      we all need each other, and God's grace is the bond that holds us together.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;" >
      <img  class="img-fluid p-4" src="images/church-1024x683.jpg" alt="Church pews" style="width: 600px; height: 350px;" class="responsive">
  </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Why is unity so necessary?</strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">In the same way a body cannot function properly if the feet do not step together, the hands are not coordinated, or the 
      organs fail, Christ's people cannot function if they are unable to cooperate. If each of us believed that we knew best and split off to 
      do our own thing, we'd never fulfill the mission our Lord gave us to spread His love and reveal His character to the world at large.  
    </p> 
    <p class="m-4">But unity isn't just meant to make Christ's body more cooperative and efficient. It's also meant to make us more 
      compassionate, able to feel the pain others go through and build them up, rather than becoming prejudiced and spending all our time 
      trying to build ourselves up.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">During Christ's time on earth, he had difficulty dealing with the disciples who followed him. They were constantly 
      bickering, arguing about who would be most important once Jesus was crowned king. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">They never understood the true point of what Jesus was trying to do until after his crucifixion. But once they put their 
      focus on Christ instead of themselves, they became great apostles, spreading Jesus' story wherever they went. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Reading the book of Acts shows us incredible examples of what God's people can do when they let go of their pride and 
      follow Jesus' command for unity.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;" >
      <img  class="img-fluid p-4" src="images/following-christs-example-1024x683.jpg" alt="People hugging each other" style="width: 500px; height: 350px;" class="responsive">
  </div>
    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Following Christ's Example</strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">Through scriptures, Jesus made it clear how important it is for his family to be unified in God, rather than wasting their 
      time bickering about who's most important or who's different. 
    </p> 
    <p class="m-4">During His time on Earth, Jesus' disciples missed out on all the important lessons He was trying to teach them because they 
      were too busy arguing about who would be 'the greatest' in the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 18:1-6, Mark 10:33-37, Luke 22:24-30). 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">God doesn't want us to miss out on lessons and blessings because of our own pride. We are called to be like a body, many 
      separate parts working towards a common purpose, cooperating and bearing each other's sorrows. This gives the body of Christ purpose and 
      direction, strengthening the body through fellowship and compassion.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Being united in mission is the only way for God's family to truly grow. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">But perhaps the most important reason of all for God's people to strive for unity is that, when we let go of our pride, put 
      others first, and try to cooperate, we are living out the example Jesus set for us.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Jesus, even while he was one earth, was in perfect unity with the Father and the <a href="god-the-holy-spirit.html" 
      style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Holy Spirit</a>. This <a href="the-godhead.html" 
      style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Trinity</a> is the perfect example of what unity should be, an example Jesus asks 
      all of his people to follow.
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
        <i>"The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they 
          may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me" (John 17:22-23, ESV).</i>
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      If we want to live by the example Christ set for us, then we need to learn how to be unified, seeing people the way Jesus sees them 
      and putting others before ourselves. 
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      This may be difficult. It is in our <a href="the-nature-of-man.html" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">human nature</a> 
      to want our own way, but if we ask Him, God promises He will give us the strength to put others first and live as a part of His family.
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">
      To experience the kind of unity that celebrates God-given uniqueness while also maintaining a feeling of usefulness, belonging and 
      purpose-this can be one of the greatest joys of being alive. It can fulfill our innermost desires as humans, especially when what 
      unites us is our Creator.
