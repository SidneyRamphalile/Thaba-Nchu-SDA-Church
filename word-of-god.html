        The Bible is the word of God, showing us how to live. It reveals God's will and teaches us timeless lessons we 
        can apply to all parts of our lives. This book tells us who God is, where we came from, how much God loves us, 
        and how we can live out His love in our own lives. That alone makes it the most precious book on earth-a steady 
        constant in a world that is always changing. Perhaps that's why the Bible remains the most-read book in the world. 
        The Bible is also a unique anthology of complex ideas and concepts. It is meant to be read with attentive care. 
        So let's take a closer look at the many roles the Bible can play in our spiritual lives:
        <ul style="text-align: center; list-style: none; " class="text-success">
            <li >The Bible was written by humans with varying perspectives</li>
            <li>The Bible as our roadmap for life</li>
            <li>The Bible as a revelation of God's will</li>
            <li>The Bible's timeless messages of perpetual relevance</li>
            <li>The Bible as a declaration of God's love</li>
        </ul>

     </div>
     <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4"><strong>WRITTEN BY DIVINE INSPIRATION TO DIVERSE HUMAN BEINGS</strong></h2>
     <p  class="m-4">God's holy word, the Bible, is unique among all other books. It was written by more than 40 authors living on three different 
        continents over a span of 1,500 years-yet its words were inspired by God. He inspired human authors and through them 
        He communicated His will to the rest of humanity (2 Peter 1:20-21).
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">That's why the Bible does so well at reaching people at 
        differing points in their lives, amid different situations, and with a wide spectrum of perspective. The Bible 
        reveals God, but through human eyes so we can relate. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">These days, people question everything. They question the news, 
        authority figures,  and even themselves. It's almost a default mindset when there's so much contradictory information 
        confronting us each day from a variety of media. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">It can sometimes feel like there's no real right answer to anything. 
        But even amid all the confusion and noise of the world, the Bible can be the one source of information that is completely 
        trustworthy. It teaches us the right way to live, reveals God's character, and holds the answer to all our big 
        questions.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">2 Timothy 3:16 even describes Scripture as "breathed out by God," 
        and "profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness" (ESV).
    </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img class="img-fluid p-4" src="images/roadmap-782x1024.jpg" alt="roadmap" style="width: 450px; height: 450px;">
    </div>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4"><strong>A ROADMAP FOR LIFE</strong></h2>
    <p  class="m-4">The psalmist once wrote: "Your word is a lamp for my feet, 
        a light on my path" (Psalm 119:105, CSB). 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">How true that is. Scripture holds instructions, wisdom, and guidance 
        for every decision we might face, serving as a roadmap for life. The Bible's pages are full of wisdom, telling 
        us what God asks of us and how He wants us to live.
    </p>
    <p class="m-4">But the Bible isn't just a collection of words and sayings, 
        it's a story. The story of the human race. It tells us how God created humanity to be perfect, 
        how humanity lost that perfection, and how God has been fighting to restore us ever since. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">The Bible is the story of humanity's flaws and failures overcome by God's 
        love and forgiveness. Humans fall short at making things right, but God will always come through.. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">This is another way the Bible serves as a roadmap. It reveals our own 
        tendencies, the flaws that came along with our fallen nature. It tells us the stories of people who struggled 
        to live in a world full of both good and evil, the choices they made, and how God worked in their lives. 
        It gives us examples of both what to do and what not to do, instructing us on the reasoning behind the 
        doctrines we practice and the choices God wants us to make.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">Although the Scriptures were meant to instruct us, there are parts of it 
        that can be confusing. Even scholars struggle with the exact meaning of some passages. There are times when it 
        seems simpler to just take the preacher's word for it instead of trying to sort things out for ourselves.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">That's how many Christians felt in the mid-1800s. 
        They were content to hear the preacher read from the pulpit and leave the difficult Bible verses 
        for someone else to study.  
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4">But not everyone felt this way. There were some who truly wanted to 
        understand the whole Bible, Old and New Testament alike. They wanted to read God's word for themselves, 
        to experience and understand His gospel and follow His commandments. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"> Out of this desire the Seventh-day Adventist Church was born, 
        led by Christians who wanted a deeper understanding of God's word. And the more they read and devoted 
        themselves to Bible study, the more they learned about who God is and His love that goes into each of His 
        instructions for us.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4"><strong>THE REVELATION OF GOD'S WILL</strong></h2>

    <p  class="m-4"> The more we learn about Scripture, the clearer it becomes that the Bible is 
        not like any other book. It is God's Word sent to human authors and passed down through generations. How else 
        could a book written over such a long span of time by so many different people of diverse backgrounds contain 
        one cohesive message? There's no way the Bible could keep its strong, united message over all that time without 
        God's hand guiding the process. He wanted to make sure the Bible gave its readers a clear, vivid message. 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"> God gave us the Holy Scriptures so that He could reveal His character, 
        and this is wonderful news! It means we don't have to keep second-guessing ourselves, wondering what God is 
        like and what He wants from us. He already gave us the answers in His Word.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"> God further revealed His will and His desire for our hearts through Jesus, 
        His son, when He sent Him down to earth to be our Messiah. The four gospels of the New Testament give us a d
        etailed account of Jesus' time on earth, demonstrating God's character and His love for us.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"> God isn't some mysterious deity wandering up in the clouds 
        and trying to hide from us. He is our loving Father and Creator, eager to be with us, and longing that 
        we might grow strong in our faith and grow closer to Him. That is the image of God Scripture shows us.
    </p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img class="img-fluid p-4" src="images/ancient scroll.jpg" alt="Ancient Scroll" style="width: 500px; height: 350px;">
    </div>

    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;" class="m-4"><strong>A TIMELESS, RELEVANT MESSAGE</strong></h2>

    <p class="m-4"> While the Holy scripture paints a picture of humanity's history and 
        offers us insight into God's will and character, it also holds many valuable morals that are just as true 
        today as the day they were written.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"> That in itself is no easy feat. Society's morals are constantly changing. 
        What might have been considered brave or noble a hundred years ago might be viewed as foolish or small-minded 
        today, or vice-versa. The world's views about what's okay, what's permissible, or what's frowned upon change 
        all the time. But God's views don't (Matthew 24:35). 
    <p  class="m-4"> The commandments He set down in the Old Testament will never change. 
        Christ's doctrines of loving our neighbors and forgiving those who wrong us will never go out of style. 
        God's law will always be "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your 
        strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself" (Luke 10:27, ESV).
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"> The lessons and instructions God put into scripture for us will never 
        become old and outdated. They will never be antiquated beliefs without use or practicality. God's word 
        transcends time and culture. His commandments will always be binding and His promises will always be true.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"> God's word is timeless, "...alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, 
        it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart" 
        (Hebrews 4:12ESV). 
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"> Even though it was written thousands of years ago, 
        the Bible still has the same strength and impact it did when God first inspired it. He put His wisdom and love into 
        each passage so that we might know Him better. That wisdom and love is still relevant and alive today.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"> God's written word has had a tremendous impact throughout history. 
        It has guided people, inspired nations, and changed hearts all over the world.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"> In 1995, the Guinness Book of World Records declared the Bible the number 
        one best-selling book of all time, with over 5 billion copies sold and distributed around the world, and 
        translated into 349 languages. How could a simple book become so wide-spread, reaching and impacting so many 
        people? This is God's word, and through it He speaks to us.
    </p>
    <p  class="m-4"> God uses Scripture to offer us a roadmap to life and give us insight 
        into humanity's story. He uses it to reveal His will and offer us timeless, relevant wisdom. The Bible has 
        been referred to as God's love letter to us, and that comparison couldn't be more true. God shows His love for 
        us by revealing His character, offering us wisdom and advice, and telling us how He sent His son to die so that 
        we could live. What love could be greater than that?
